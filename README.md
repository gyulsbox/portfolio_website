# Website for Portfolio
 
 Creating a website for the portfolio.<br>
 It is still in progress, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used.
 
 The screen configuration of the mobile scale is still at the shell level and will be configured at the end.<br>
 Currently, it is optimized for desktops. (width: more than 752px)
 
 I wrote a list at the back, which I just wrote down what to modify.
